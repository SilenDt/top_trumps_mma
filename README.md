# Getting Started with TopTrumpsMMA

This project is a browser based appliction (client) which relies on a locally hosted database to serve URL requests to athe browser. Both client and server sides are contained in this repo. To run the app you will need to run both the client and server. See the README in both client and server folders for instructions on how to do this. 

The client side of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The server side of this project relies on a [mongoDB] client (https://www.mongodb.com).
